Environment & Stack:
====================
I am using Python 3.8.9 with a list of packages that can be found in `requirements.txt <./requirements.txt>`_.  I am also using Jupyter.  I prefer to use VS Code to edit and view them.

If you would like to run this project yourself, execute the following commands in your shell:

..  code-block:: sh

    $ git clone https://github.com/johnmays/wealth-and-SAT-NYC.git
    $ cd wealth-and-SAT-NYC
    wealth-and-SAT-NYC $ pip install virtualenv
    wealth-and-SAT-NYC $ virtualenv -p < optional path to python 3.8 > venv
    wealth-and-SAT-NYC $ source venv/bin/activate
    (venv) wealth-and-SAT-NYC $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    (venv) wealth-and-SAT-NYC $ mkdir data

then, download the requisite data from the `NYC Open Data website <https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/>`_ into the ``/data`` directory and the notebook should run!
